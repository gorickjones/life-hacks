# How to email inside your organization or team.

This is intended to support the use of email in a team setting. It benefits from the many email crimes I have committed.

## Add someone to a long thread

(Where long is more than two emails, requires scrolling)

It often happens, a discussion over email can benefits from the expertise of someone not on the thread and you want to add them. Here's how:
1. Be clear you are adding them at the very top of your note. 
> You can do this by writing "+Name". In my organizational email set-ups, "@Name" prompts to add their name and puts them on the "To:" line of the email. Do this for every person you are adding. You will end up with something like "+Name1, Name2, etc." or "@Name1, @Name2, etc" at the top of your email.
**Why do this?** So everyone else on the thread knows a new person has been introduced.
2. Summarize the thread for your new additions. i do this at the very top so they -- and everyone else -- know why you are adding them.

## About This Project

This project welcomes [contributions](CONTRIBUTING.md). It is [licensed to use](LICENSE). 

This project has been created by [Marnie Webb](https://crank.report/about-me) to: share what I've learned from working with interns and young professionals over the last 20 years; share the great advice I've received and the feedback I've gotten; and, save my daughter from having to listen to regular how to grow up lectures.


## Inspiration

1. [Phil Agre's excellent advice](https://pages.gseis.ucla.edu/faculty/agre/) for graduate students.
2. All of the excellent interns I've worked with who are open and curious and ask for help.
3. My daughter's high school internship class.

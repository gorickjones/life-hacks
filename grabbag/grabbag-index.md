Short bits of advice that don't quite fit in elsewhere.

1. If your organization has brand guidelines/stylesheets/templates use them for every single document, presentation, spreadsheet, website you create.  If you are thinking things through use the default template/theme in the tool of your choice.
2. When you create documents, presntations, spreadsheets, or websites, use headings and all other elements. It makes everything else easier for everyone else.
3. Use your own writing tool for thinking (I love [Bear](https://bear.app) for this).  This becomes the place you think and it's create to have a different environment.  Switch it to your organization's standard tool when you are ready to share.
4. Build a career by picking some thorny complex problems and work to solve those problems over the course of your career, no matter the job you have.
5. When making a slide deck presentation, always use a full sentence as the title of each slide. When you read the slide titles, they should tell a clear story.

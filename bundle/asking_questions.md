# Asking Questions

I still point to [How to Ask Questions the Smart Way](http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html). You really should read it.  Still, here's the bullet point version:

- Try to find the answer yourself. This means that you spend some time searching for an answer.
- Make your question as specific as possible. This means that you often share what you are trying to accomplish and describing what isn't working. 
- Describe what you have tried to do solve the problem. TheÂ  place in the documents that describes what you are trying to do, other forum threads, different solutions you tried to implement and what went wrong.
- Before you hit send, ask [the rubber duck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging). Sometimes, just saying the whole thing ou tloud and working through this level of detail let's you see something you didn't see before. Try it and see if that works.
- Find one place to ask and hit send.
- Show up on thread to answer questions, test solutions, and tell people when you have found one that works.

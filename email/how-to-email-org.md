# How to email inside your organization or with your team.

This is intended to support the use of email in a team setting. It benefits from the many email crimes I have committed.

## Add someone to an existing thread

(Where long is more than two emails, requires scrolling)

It often happens: A discussion over email can benefit from the expertise of someone not on the thread, and you want to add them. Here's how:

**1. Be clear you are adding them at the very top of your note.**

You can do this by writing "+Name". In my organizational email set-ups, "@Name" prompts to add their name and puts them on the "To:" line of the email. Do this for every person you are adding. You will end up with something like "+Name1, Name2, etc." or "@Name1, @Name2, etc" at the top of your email.

*Why do this?* So everyone else on the thread knows a new person has been introduced.

**2. Summarize the thread for your new additions.**

Drop down a line, address the newcomers by name and make it easy for them to know what is most relevant to them. Write something like:
> Name1 and Name2, We are trying to understand the reasons that the numbers are low this month. I have reattached the CSV file for your reference. In the course of the discussion, BillyBob suggested it might be because of site slow down issues. See the below discussion for more context, if you need it.

*Why do this?* You are helping them by focusing on key points and making it easier for them to contribute to the conversation. 

**3. Tell them why you are adding them.**

Once you have summarized be very specific about what they can contribute to the discussion. Something like:

> Can you please review the logs for this month and let this group know if you see any changes in the speed with which these key pages load: page1, page2? 

*Why do this?* You aren't leaving them guessing about what you want them to do next.

**4. Invite them to add addition thoughts, if you want that.**

You may also want people to add additional comments. Ask them! Write something like:

> If you think of or see anything else that might be impacting the numbers this month, please let this group know that as well.

*Why do this?* They are professionals and know their jobs. They want to help. Don't limit them to questions you know to ask.

### Notes

This example is a pretty straightforward one in which you are asking a colleague for their specific expertise. It works well in most situations. 

Want your boss' opinion on a document you are preparing for a client?
> +Boss
>
> Boss, We've been working on the web design proposal for Client1. We have a solid draft, attached. I am writing today to ask for your final review before sending to the client. In particular, please review the timeline. I am not sure what other work is in the pipeline and want to be sure we are setting solid expectations. Please do comment on any parts of the proposal. Our discussion on the proposal is below if that context is helpful to you. We will incorporate your edits in the next version. We want to send the propsal by mid-day, DAY, DATE. Can you get your comments back to us by end of day DAY, DATE?

Stuck and need someone else to weigh in?

> +Name
>
> Name, We've been having a long debate about whether or not we should go after Big Contract. You can read the whole discussion below. Here are the most relevant parts:
> - The contract is AMOUNT starts MONTH, YEAR and is expected to last DURATION. 
> - We believe we can do this but will have to staff up.
> - We have never done a project this large and are worried about...
> - We don't know much about the client and worry about...
> - Bidding on this, even if we don't get it, gives us a chance to...
>
> With that in mind, do you think this is an opportunity worth pursuing? Any other considerations you think we should factor in? Any one else we should talk to before making the call?
>
> We have to make the go-no go decision by DAY, DATE so we can write the proposal. You thoughts will help inform that decision. please send them to us -- no matter how rough -- by end of day, DAY, DATE.

1. Suggest a section! The roadmap is on the wiki. If you want a section and don't see it create an issue to request it.
2. Contribute a section! Is there something on the roadmap you'd like to write? Write it and create a pull request.
3. Combine "suggest" and "contribute" and make a whole new section. And then create a pull request.
4. Fix a typo. Pull request or create an issue.
5. Improve a section. Got a better way to do it? Start a discussion or create an issue.
